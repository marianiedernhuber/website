I am a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience in the Consciousness and Cognition Lab, University of Cambridge (with Tristan Bekinschtein) and at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience: Body, Self, Plasticity Lab (with Bigna Lenggenhager). My goal is to apply insights from cognitive neuroscience and technology to assist patient rehabilitation. My current work is focused on the development of data-driven tools which uses insights from cognitive science, neurobiology, medicine and patient experience to improve quality of life for chronic pain patients. Beyond that, I have a special interest in diversity and the empowerment of minorities.
