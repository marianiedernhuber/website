title: "Prediction and Perception in the Multisensory Brain"
date: "2021-03-01T00:00:00Z"
summary: "To enable sensory perception, the brain evolved a hierarchy of cortices for each sense. A challenge in neuroscience is to characterise commonalities and differences in the representations and mechanisms operating within and controlling neural signalling between cortical hierarchies dedicated to different sensory organs. Here we show that representations supporting cortical responses elicited by sensory prediction violations travelling along the cortical hierarchy are increasingly shared between the senses. To that end, we designed two multisensory variants of the local-global paradigm which violates expectations about sensory inputs at two hierarchical levels: local and global. First, we demonstrate that the local-global paradigm can dissociate higher-order P3b-like global effects and lower-order MMN-like local effects in the auditory and the somatosensory modality. We show that cortical representations supporting the global effect are maintained in time in networks shared between the senses. Conversely, cortical activity underpinning the local effect is largely specific to each sensory domain. Building up on my finding that attention enhances ERP signatures of local and global effects across sensory modalities, we demonstrate that salient deviations are associated with increased connectivity between bilateral inferior frontal gyri in the somatosensory and the auditory domain. Ultimately, we elucidate the representational and mechanistic basis of cortical responses arising from mismatching sensory modalities. We provide evidence for the notion that information flow elicited by crossmodal mismatches is ubiquitous between the cortical hierarchies in which the sensory prediction was generated and violated respectively. We then show that crossmodal mismatches rely on cortical representations which are sustained in time in an early time window consistent with the involvement of networks spanning associative and attention-related cortices. Since these markers were shown to selectively index levels of conscious awareness, we envision that this research might contribute to an empirical basis for an EEG-based tool to prognosticate recovery of conscious awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness."
