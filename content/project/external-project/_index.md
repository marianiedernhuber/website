summary: We develop a telemedicine pain assessment and management tool which integrates the neurophysiological and cognitive dynamics underlying chronic pain with phenomenological (experiential) analyses of patients’ self-reports. To achieve this, we adopt an innovative, personalised, and fully remote (home-based) testing platform based on wearable neurotechnology and a novel online tool for sampling and tracking cognitive pain modulators and pain levels. Our research understands chronic pain as a biological and a psychosocial phenomenon associated with conscious experiences shaped by embodied, biological and psychosocial factors. On this basis, our project integrates knowledge and technical advances from neuroscience of embodiment (Body, Self and Plasticity Lab, UZH), computational biology (Consciousness and Cognition Lab Cambridge), neurotechnology and precision psychiatry (Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, EPFL, Biotech Campus Geneva) with patients’ lived experience of their condition. The tool consists of an interactive and modular system applicable in a home setting which encompasses software and hardware as well as best practise of virtual patient interactions in an online environment enabling neurophysiological, biophysiological, phenomenological and behavioural data streaming. Second, we will apply this integrated tool to better understand chronic pain and its dynamic modulation by attention and body-brain interactions with the aim to predict future pain levels. Rather than finding an unique diagnostic criterion for chronic pain solely based on neurophysiological correlates of pain ratings, we track various aspects of pain over several weeks to identify the neurophysiological, cognitive, phenomenological and emotional precursors of pain enabling a better prediction of its time course. We envision that our tool is a cost-effective method for the assessment, prediction and characterization of complex experiences in patients with chronic pain. We believe that our tool and procedures might form the basis for health medicine applications in the industry (e.g., start-ups planning to release a customisable pain tracking tool) as well as further basic research (e.g., tracking mental states in other neuropsychiatric/pain conditions).
